# Hinglish Prompting Strategy for The Synthetic Radio Host - Wiki-talks

## How We Achieve Natural Hinglish Conversations

We evolved from generic "convert to Hinglish" instructions to a structured **PERSONA → CONTEXT → TASK → FORMAT** framework with three key improvements:

1. **Explicit Language Ratio**: Specified "50% Hindi, 50% English" rather than vague "use Hinglish."

2. **Good/Bad Examples**: Showed concrete patterns like *Bad:* "I am going to the market" vs *Good:* "I am going to the market, tu chalega?" — and anti-patterns like redundant grammar ("What's the scene kya hai?").

3. **Emotion Over Facts**: Instructed the model to convert Wikipedia-style facts/dates into emotional reactions (shock, pride) rather than dry narration, making conversations feel natural rather than scripted readings.
